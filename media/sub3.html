										Renowned for their scenic splendor, the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks are comprised of Banff, Jasper, 
										Kootenay and Yoho national parks and Mount Robson, Mount Assiniboine and Hamber provincial parks. 
										Together, they exemplify the outstanding physical features of the Rocky Mountain Biogeographical Province. 
										Classic illustrations of glacial geological processes — including ice fields, remnant valley glaciers, canyons 
										and exceptional examples of erosion and deposition — are found throughout the area. The Burgess Shale Cambrian 
										fossil sites and nearby Precambrian sites contain important information about the earth's evolution.
										The seven parks of the Canadian Rockies form a striking mountain landscape. With rugged mountain peaks, ice fields, 
										and glaciers, alpine meadows, lakes, waterfalls, extensive karst cave systems, thermal springs and deeply incised canyons, 
										the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks possess exceptional natural beauty, attracting millions of visitors annually.

									The significance of the landscape of Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump lies in its historical, archaeological and scientific interest.
								    The deep, undisturbed layers of animal bones (largely American Bison) represent nearly 6,000 years of continuous occupation with 
									one lengthy period of unexplained interrupted hunting. This landscape is an outstanding example of subsistence hunting that 
									continued into the late 19th century and which still forms part of the 'traditional knowledge base' of the Plains nations. 
									It throws valuable light on the way of life and practices of traditional hunting cultures elsewhere in the world.
									Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump is one of the oldest, most extensive and best preserved sites that illustrate communal hunting
								    techniques and of the way of life of Plains people who, for more than five millennia, subsisted on the vast herds of bison that
								    existed in North America.

									Founded in the 17th century, Québec City bears eloquent testimony to important stages in the European settlement 
									of the Americas: it was the capital of New France and, after 1760, of the new British colony. The Historic District of Old Québec 
									is an urban area of about 135 hectares. It is made up to two parts: the Upper Town, sitting atop Cap Diamant and defended by fortified ramparts, 
									a citadel, and other defensive works, and the Lower Town, which grew up around Place Royale and the harbour. A well-preserved 
									integrated urban ensemble, the historic district is a remarkable example of a fortified colonial town, and unique north of Mexico.
									The Historic District of Old Québec is authentic in terms of its form and design, materials and substance, and location and setting. 
									Since the time of its inscription, the property has changed considerably, particularly with respect to the organization of its historic urban 
									landscape. However, the attributes of the property express its outstanding universal value in a truthful and credible manner.

									Nahanni National Park World Heritage property, located in Canada's Northwest Territories, is a 470,000 hectare
								    undisturbed natural area of deep river canyons cutting through mountain ranges, with huge waterfalls and complex cave systems. 
									The geomorphology of the property is outstanding in its wealth of form and complexity of evolution. Fluvial processes and 
									features predominate. Within the property are examples of almost every distinct category of river or stream that is known, 
									along with one of North America's most impressive waterfalls, Virginia Falls. The Flat River and South Nahanni River are 
									older than the mountains they dissect and have produced the finest examples of river canyons in the world, north of 60º. 
									The injection of igneous rock through tectonic activity has resulted in spectacular granitic peaks.

									Old Town Lunenburg is the best surviving example of a planned British colonial settlement in North America. 
									Established in 1753, it has retained its original layout and overall appearance, based on a rectangular grid pattern 
									drawn up in the home country. The inhabitants have safeguarded the town's identity throughout the centuries by preserving 
									the wooden architecture of the houses and public buildings, some of which date from the 18th century and constitute 
									an excellent example of a sustained vernacular architectural tradition. Its economic basis has traditionally been the offshore 
									Atlantic fishery, the future of which is highly questionable at the present time.

									The Rideau Canal is a large strategic canal constructed for military purposes which played a crucial contributory role
									 in allowing British forces to defend the colony of Canada against the United States of America, leading to the development 
									 of two distinct political and cultural entities in the north of the American continent, which can be seen as a significant 
									 stage in human history.The Rideau Canal remains the best preserved example of a slackwater canal in North America demonstrating 
									 the use of European slackwater technology in North America on a large scale. It is the only canal dating from the great North American 
									 canal-building era of the early 19th century that remains operational along its original line with most of its original structures intact.
									 The Rideau Canal is an extensive, well preserved and significant example of a canal which was used for a military purpose linked to a significant 
									 stage in human history - that of the fight to control the north of the American continent.

									Mistaken Point is a globally significant Ediacaran fossil site almost entirely located within Mistaken Point Ecological 
									Reserve on the south-eastern tip of the island of Newfoundland in eastern Canada. The 146-hectare property consists of a narrow, 
									17-kilometre-long strip of rugged naturally-eroding coastal cliffs, with an additional 74 hectares adjoining its landward margin 
									designated as a buffer zone. The superbly exposed, 2-kilometre-thick rock sequence of deep marine origin at Mistaken Point dates 
									to the middle Ediacaran Period (580 to 560 million years ago) and contains exquisitely preserved assemblages of the oldest abundant 
									and diverse, large fossils known anywhere.More than 10,000 fossil impressions, ranging from a few centimetres to nearly 2 metres 
									in length, are readily visible for scientific study and supervised viewing along the coastline of Mistaken Point. These fossils 
									illustrate a critical watershed in the early history of life on Earth: the appearance of large, biologically complex organisms, 
									including the first ancestral animals. Most of the fossils are rangeomorphs, an extinct group of fractal organisms positioned 
									near the base of animal evolution. These soft-bodied creatures lived on the deep-sea floor, and were buried and preserved in 
									exceptional detail by influxes of volcanic ash - each layer of ash creating an “Ediacaran Pompeii.” Modern erosion has exhumed 
									more than 100 fossil sea-floor surfaces, ranging from small beds with single fossils to larger surfaces adorned with up to 4,500 
									megafossils. The animals died where they lived, and their resultant fossil assemblages preserve both the morphology of extinct 
									groups of ancestral animals and the ecological structure of their ancient communities. Radiometric dating of the volcanic ash beds 
									that directly overlie the fossil-bearing surfaces is providing a detailed chronology for 20 million years in the early evolution of 
									complex life.

										<dd>
											The Kluane / Wrangell-St. Elias / Glacier Bay / Tatshenshini-Alsek national parks and protected areas 
											along the boundary of Canada and the United States of America contain the largest non-polar icefield 
											in the world as well as examples of some of the world's longest and most spectacular glaciers. 
											Characterized by high mountains, icefields and glaciers, the property transitions from northern 
											interior to coastal biogeoclimatic zones, resulting in high biodiversity with plant and animal communities 
											ranging from marine, coastal forest, montane, sub-alpine and alpine tundra, all in various successional stages. 
											The Tatshenshini and Alsek river valleys are pivotal because they allow ice-free linkages from coast to interior 
											for plant and animal migration. The parks demonstrate some of the best examples of glaciation and modification of 
											landscape by glacial action in a region still tectonically active, spectacularly beautiful, and where natural 
											processes prevail.
